# Medical Image Security and Anomaly Detection: Project Phase – I 

## 📋 Overview  
This folder contains the deliverables for **Phase I** of the project titled *Medical Image Security and Anomaly Detection*. The primary focus of this phase is on the “Medical Image Security” component — specifically, End-to-End image encryption using hybrid cryptographic/encryption algorithms to ensure confidentiality before the anomaly detection part is applied.

## Proposed Hybrid Encryption Algorithms
1. RSA+AES+SHA-256
2. ECC+AES+SHA-256
3. AES+SHA-256
4. CHAOTIC MAPS+AES
5.  DNA CRYPTOGRAPHY+AES
6. BLOWFISH+SHA-256
7. DES+AES+MD5
